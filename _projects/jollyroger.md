The JollyRoger ShipBot is a mechatronic design capstone class project.
For this project we built an agile robot that could autonomously
manipulate a fixed set of electro-mechanical devices such as valves
and breaker switches given some high level commands.
The motivation of this project is to provide a
proof-of-concept mechatronic device that could fit on long-distance
navigating ships to help reduce human intervention.

I was primarily responsible for system design, electrical platform bringup,
localization & locomotion algorithms, embedded RTOS development and
final system integration.
I also made some contribution to our 5-DOF arm kinematics.

This is a fairly complicated system built almost from the ground up. Thanks to
the effort of all our team members (Sara Misra, Bo Tian, Fiona Li and David
Bang), we were able to pull such a feat and create an excellent system that
won the final competition with an reward of $5,500.

Special thanks to professor [Cameron Riviere][criviere] and all the TA's for
providing us with all the resources we need and helping us keep our project on
track! Also huge thanks to [Leidos][leidos] who sponsored this class project
and made all this possible!
