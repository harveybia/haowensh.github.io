The Blaser scanner is a high performance minature laser scanner useful
particularly for confined space perception. See more details [here][blaser].

"The Blaser sensor is capable of directly generating and processing 3D point
cloud information onboard while providing direct high-level feedback or even
command to any ROS-enabled or other robotic systems." - Biorobotics lab, CMU
