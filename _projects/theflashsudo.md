The Mobot race is a Carnegie Mellon tradition which is held annually at
Spring carnivals. It's a tribute to the "hello world" of robotics - a line
following robot, but more complicated due to the tough terrain.
Check out the [Mobot Homepage][mobot_homepage] for more
information.

#### Motivation
In freshman year I had a bunch of free time and looked for something fun to
do. I saw posters of the mobot race and decided to do it for fun.
I led a team of three (shout out to my temmates Matthew Zhao and Elias Lu)
and started making the robot about 4 months from the competition.
Since this was my first extra curricular project, I took it seriously and
spent a lot of time developing.

#### System
LEGO EV3 Chassis, BrickPi + RaspberryPi LEGO Controller, RasPi Camera,
LiPo Battery. The project is open source and can be found in our
GitHub repository.

<!-- #### Why LEGO?
I started my robot making career at 3rd grade with LEGO Mindstorms RCX kits,
and have participated in a wide range of robot competitions (FLL, WRO, etc.)
since then using the LEGO platform. Elias is a LEGO fanatic too, beating
me in several of these competitions. -->

#### Results
First place among all participants (undergrad + grad), 11 gates in 4 minutes,
prize money $1,000. You can watch the final competition [here][video_link].
