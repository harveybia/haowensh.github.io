## Abstract

In this project we implemented a LiDAR depth image rendering too which takes in
LiDAR 3D point clouds in the world frame and renders a depth image
from the cameraâ€™s field of view by transforming and projecting these points.

We implemented sequential (one process on single CPU core),
OpenMP, and CUDA versions, then benchmarked and compared their performance.

## Framework

### OpenMP

![OpenMP](/assets/img/2020/parallel/renderer_omp_arch.png)

In this implementation,
we group up the incoming lidar points and distribute them evenly across
number of designated cores.

### CUDA

![CUDA](/assets/img/2020/parallel/renderer_cuda_arch.png)

In this implementation,
we have the same workload splitting strategy but spread them across
many more GPU compute cores. Because we could not use the PCL library
on CUDA code, we designed custom data wrappers for low-overhead communication
between CPU and GPU and implemented some PCL pcocessing code ourselves.

## Results

![Speedup](/assets/img/2020/parallel/impl_ftime.png)

For the same dataset with constant high workload for the renderer,
We achieved on average, maximum of 2.9x speedup for OpenMP implementation
and 120x speedup for CUDA implementation.
